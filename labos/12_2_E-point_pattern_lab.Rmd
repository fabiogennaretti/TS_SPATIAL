## Lab Objective

Analyze spatial point patterns using CSR (complete spatial randomness) as a null model. Detect clustering or repulsion, evaluate the effect of spatial heterogeneity, and test the independence between two point patterns.

## Part 1: Introduction and CSR

**(1a) Generate a point pattern with complete spatial randomness (CSR) using intensity $\lambda$ = 100. Plot it.**

**(1b) What is complete spatial randomness (CSR) and which statistical model represents it?**

**(1C) Generate: an aggregated pattern using rMatClust(), a repulsive pattern using rMaternII(). Plot all three patterns (CSR, aggregation, repulsion) side-by-side.**

**(1d) What visual differences do you observe between the three patterns?**

## Part 2: Ripley’s K and null model testing

**(2a) Compute and plot Ripley’s K function with simulation envelopes for each of the three patterns.**

**(2b) How do you interpret a K(r) curve above or below the theoretical curve? Which of the patterns significantly deviates from CSR? At what range of distances?**

## Part 3: Heterogeneous intensity

**(3a) Simulate a heterogeneous point pattern with a non-uniform intensity function as argument of *rpoispp*. Plot the pattern.**

**(3b) Why can a density gradient be mistaken for spatial analyses?**

**(3c) Compare K estimates with and without correcting for heterogeneity (express the pattern in the *simulate* argument of the function *envelope*).**

**(3d) Which characteristic helps distinguish a density gradient from true clustering/aggregation?**
